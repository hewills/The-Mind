# The Mind
MAGS game - March 2020
-------------------------------
MAGS is a monthly game making competition, using the Adventure Game Studios tool. This month's theme is 'Death defying'.
I admit this is a bit of a stretch, theme-wise, but it technically fits.

This is a videogame version of the card game 'The Mind'. It is a cooperative game, you play with others.

In this version, you and your dog meet Death, after a stunt gone wrong. You are given the chance to play
a game, to avoid the afterlife. However, you and your dog 'Elska' must play together.
That game is... The Mind.
